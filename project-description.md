# Test Project Outline – Module A – DineEase Showcase Website

## Competition time

3 hours

## Introduction

This project focuses on creating a captivating promotional website for DineEase, a revolutionary dining platform that aims to enhance the dining experience. DineEase is a small startup initially based in Hungary that made waves in the restaurant industry with their innovative restaurant software. Now, they are expanding their horizons with a brand new service designed to revolutionize how people discover, explore, and engage with restaurants.

The DineEase platform serves as an all-in-one portal and progressive web application where visitors can choose between restaurants, view full menus, read reviews from previous guests about restaurant service and food, book tables, and order and pay through the website or app. This promotional website should showcase the service's features and entice users to explore and use the DineEase platform for their dining needs.

## General Description of Project and Tasks

The website must consist of five different pages: Home, About Us, Contact, Privacy Policy, and Terms of Use. The design of all subpages should be visually aligned, creating a cohesive and harmonious user experience. Consistency in layout, typography, and color schemes is key to reinforcing the DineEase brand identity.

A graphic designer has already created a website design that should be followed as closely as possible. The design files, images, and text content can be found in the `assets` folder.

The website must be responsive and support at least the following viewports:
- Mobile: 360×640
- Tablet: 768×1024  
- Desktop: 1920×1080

No server-side or client-side frameworks are allowed for this project, as the focus is on pure HTML and CSS development. CSS preprocessors such as Sass or Less may be used to streamline the CSS workflow, but the generated CSS code must pass W3C validations.

All HTML and CSS code must pass W3C validations. The website must conform to accessibility standards (WCAG) and implement SEO best practices to optimize it for search engine visibility and attract organic traffic.
